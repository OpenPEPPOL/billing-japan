= Calculation of CT

One CT Breakdown shall be provided for each distinct combination of CT category code and CT rate found in either the line CT information or the Document level allowance or charges.

For each distinct combination of CT category code and CT rate the calculations are:
====
stem:["CT category taxable amount (IBT-116)" = sum("Invoice line net amounts (IBT-131)")] +
stem:[+ "Document level charge amount (IBT-99)" - "Document level allowance amount (IBT-92)"]
====

====
stem:["CT category tax amount (IBT-117)" = "CT category taxable amount (IBT-116)" times ("CT rate (IBT-119)" div 100)]
====

IMPORTANT: For CT Breakdown where the CT Category is "Not subject to CT" (O), the CT category tax amount shall be zero.

IMPORTANT: Consumption Tax category tax amount (BT-117) = Consumption Tax category taxable amount (IBT-116) x (Consumption Tax category rate (IBT-119) / 100), rounded to integer. The rounded result amount SHALL be between the amount rounded down to integer value as floor and the amount rounded up to integer value as ceiling. (jp-br-co-01).
