== Invoice line net amount (BT-131)

The invoice line net amount (BT-131) is as the name implies the *net* amount without CT, and inclusive of line level allowance and charges.

The formula for calculating the invoice line net amount is:

====
stem:["Item line net amount" = (("Item net price (BT-146)" div "Item price base quantity (BT-149)")] +
stem:[times ("Invoiced Quantity (BT-129)")] +
stem:[+ "Invoice line charge amount (BT-141)" - "Invoice line allowance amount (BT-136)"]
====

IMPORTANT: As the line net amount must be rounded to no decimals, please note that the different parts of the calculation must be rounded separately. +
I.e the result of
stem:["Item line net amount" = (("Item net price (BT-146)" div "Item price base quantity (BT-149)") times ("Invoiced Quantity (BT-129)")]
must be rounded to no decimals, and the allowance/charge amounts are also rounded separately.
