= Rounding


To minimize the risk of differences due to rounding, the following rules apply:

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If Invoice currency code(ibt-005) is "JPY", all document level amounts shall have no decimals for accounting.
* If Invoice currency code(ibt-005) is "JPY", invoice line net amount shall be rounded. 
* Results from calculations involving already rounded amounts are not subject to rounding, like payable amounts and total amounts included CT.
====

Please also see <<Calculation>> for details on how to calculate the different amounts.
