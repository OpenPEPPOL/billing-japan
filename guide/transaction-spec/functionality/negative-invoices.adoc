= Negative invoices and credit notes


This BIS supports negative grand totals. 

The argument for negative invoices is to open up for a wider spectrum of invoicing processes.

Examples of such processes are

*	Preliminary (estimated) consumption invoice that is balanced out in a later meter-based invoice;
*	Pre-payment (with or without VAT) is settled through a final invoice; and
* Some user communities prefer to use negative invoice rather than credit note when correcting transactions.

====
NOTE: Buyers who value automatic matching of e-invoices to orders or invoicing objects may wish to limit the areas and situations where complex transactions can be accepted and voice their requirements at time of procurement.

The decision has the following implications on the transaction format:

* The invoice (now with “negative invoice capacity”) can function as an alternative to the credit note. Invoice-generating systems may implement either option, while invoice-receiving systems have to support both of them.
*	The transaction format for credit note has to be designed to accommodate for negative grand total, as well; this is because an entire negative invoice may have to be balanced out by means of a credit note.

Attention is drawn to the intrinsic differences between credit note and negative invoice when it comes to convey crediting information.
