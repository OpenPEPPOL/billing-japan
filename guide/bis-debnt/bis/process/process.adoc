= Debit Note process

In the debit note process, the supplier sends a debit note to the buyer with each delivery and the buyer uses the information in the debit note to verify the reception of the items. The debit note is focused on providing information about the items that are being delivered.

The invoicing process is shown in this work flow:

* A supplier can send one or more debit note along with the deliveries of items. The debit note refers to the order and provides information about the items and their quantities. The customer can use the debit note to control the receiption of the items.
