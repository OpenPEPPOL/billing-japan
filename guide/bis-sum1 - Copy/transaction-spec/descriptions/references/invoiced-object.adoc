= Invoiced object identifier

The invoiced object identifier is the identifier for an object on which the invoice is based, given by the Seller. Examples may be a subscription number, telephone number, meter point, vehicle, person etc., as applicable.

If it is not clear to the receiver what scheme is used for the identifier, a conditional scheme identifier should be used, that shall be chosen from the <<inv-object-code>>.
