[[orderref]]
= Purchase order and sales order reference

The purchase order is **conditional**. If order reference exist, use that, else use Buyer reference (see <<buyerref>>).

The customer will issue an order with a unique order number. This unique purchase order number should be supplied as the order reference on the invoice.

If order reference is stated at header level, the order reference element on line level can be used to state the order line numbers.

A sales order is issued by the seller, confirming the sale of specified products.

IMPORTANT: In the invoice, both a purchase order and a sales order reference can be given, but be aware that an invoice instance cannot have a sales order reference, without the corresponding purchase order reference.
