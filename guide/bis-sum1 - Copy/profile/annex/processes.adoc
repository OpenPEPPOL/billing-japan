= Restrictions on the supported processes

Chapter 5.2 in the {PINT} defines the business processes supported by the {PINT}.

This Country Specification has made restrictions to not explicitly support the following business processes:

TBD

P10 - Corrective invoicing::
The process as descibed for corrective invoicing was seen as unclear as to the  differentiating between a corrective invoice and a credit note, and this process was set to be out of scope.

P11 - Partial and final invoicing::
Due to the fact that partial and final invoices does not require all information that is mandated, this process is out of scope for this PEPPOL BIS.

P12 - Self billing:: Directive 2006/112/EC (Article 224) requires a specific process to be observed, involving prior agreement and a procedure where the supplier is to accept each invoice. Self-billing requires a specific set-up due to the requirements for prior agreement and procedure for the acceptance of each self-bill. Specific milestones have to be observed at time of setting it up as well as in the operation of self-billing.
