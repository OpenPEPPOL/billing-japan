= Rounding


To minimize the risk of differences due to rounding, the following rules apply:

[IMPORTANT]
====
* All document level amounts shall be rounded to two decimals for accounting
* Invoice line net amount shall be rounded to two decimals
* Results from calculations involving already rounded amounts are not subject to rounding, like payable amounts and total amounts included VAT.
====

Please also see <<Calculation>> for details on how to calculate the different amounts.
