= VAT accounting currency

Article 230 of {VAT-dir} states:
[quote]
____
The amounts which appear on the invoice may be expressed in
any currency, provided that the amount of VAT payable is
expressed in the national currency of the Member State in which
the supply of goods or services takes place, using the conversion
mechanism laid down in Article 91.
____


If the invoice currency is different from the national currency, this is expressed in the invoice by stating the national currency in the element VAT accounting currency (BT-6), and the amount of VAT payable in national currency is stated in the element Invoice total VAT amount in accounting currency (BT-111). The exchange rate to use for calculating is described in Article 91 of {VAT-dir}. The exchange rate is not specified in the invoice instance, and hence this calculation is not validated.
