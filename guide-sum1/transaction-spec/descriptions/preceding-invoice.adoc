= Preceding invoice references

A credit note or negative invoice can refer to one or more initial invoice(s). This is done in the business group BG-3 Preceding invoice reference, providing the invoice number and issue date. The issue date shall be provided in case the preceding invoice reference is not unique.

In case correction applies to a large number of invoices, the invoicing period (BG-14), as necessary combined with a clarifying invoice note (BT-22), may instead be be given at document level.
